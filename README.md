# POE-Part-1
My Recipe Application begins by displaying to the user a menu in order for them to enter the details of their desired recipe.
The RecipeDetails() class allows the user to enter the name and number of ingredients used in the recipe as well as the steps involved. These steps are then stored in arrays.
The user is then able to display their recipe with the ingredients, quantity of these ingredients and steps displayed.
If desired, users are able to half, double or triple the quantities of their recipe, and if needed, they are able to reset to the original values entered.
The user is also able to completely reset the application to zero as well as exit the application.
